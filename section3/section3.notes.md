# Creating Docker Images

- this section focuses on creating new docker images, via using dockerfiles

## Instructions

## Mental exercise to visualize docker containers 

- Imagine you are installing chrome, on a fresh new PC.
- What would you do?
- Steps to take:

1. install os.
2. Start up default browser.
3. Navigate to chrome.google.com
4. Download installer.
5. Open file/folder explorer.
6. Execute chrome_installer.exe
7. Execute chrome.exe

- These are manual steps taken by an individual to install chrome.
- These same steps are used in the `./Dockerfile` to create a docker image.
